This is the first release of the application and a working framework for our application.

MusicMe is now able to:

Take a text input from the user.
Analyze the input for its mood.
Query songs based on song key, energy, danceability, and acousticness based on the perceived mood from a Firebase database.
Play songs on the users iPhone through the Spotify application on a user's phone (requires Spotify premium).
